Laser Defender was a project made along side a Unity 2D tutorial by GameDev.tv.
It was my first game I actually completed to its full original vision.
Move using WASD or the arrow keys and shoot via the spacebar. Enemies continue looping until you die. Your score is shown at the end screen.
It was really interesting tuning and designing the waves and enemies to feel unique and fun but also challenging.
