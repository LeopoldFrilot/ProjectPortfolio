# ProjectPortfolio
This is a collection of games that I have made. Every folder represents a different game and will have their own executable in each folder. The games are ordered chronologically base on start date.

Games on itch.io:
Momentous: https://coach-butters.itch.io/momentous
Big Head Volley: https://coach-butters.itch.io/big-head-volley
Neurosurf: https://coach-butters.itch.io/neurosurf

Instructions to download and play a game:
1. On "ProjectPortfolio" home page, click "Clone/Download" and download the zip file.
2. Open the zip file and drag the folder of the game you want to play onto the computer's desktop or wherever you want to extract the game.
3. Open the folder you just extracted; there should be an executable with the game's name.
4. Double-click the executable to run the game.
