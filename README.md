# ProjectPortfolio
This is a collection of games that I have made. Every folder represents a different game and will have their own executable in each folder. The games are ordered chronologically base on start date.

Instructions to play a game:
1. On "ProjectPortfolio" home page, click "Clone/Download" and download the zip file.
2. Open the zip file and drag the folder of the game you want to play onto the computer's desktop or wherever you want to extract the game.
3. Open the folder you just extracted; there should be an executable with the game's name.
4. Double-click the executable to run the game.

note: some games do not have a menu system implemented yet so you may need to press "alt+tab" to get out of them and close them via the task bar. This will soon be fixed.
