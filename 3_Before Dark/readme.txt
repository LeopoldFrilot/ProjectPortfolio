This was a game put together by five people for a class project. 
I created almost all scripts for the game, and all of these were created from scratch except the saving/loading scripts.
I also created the UI elements using Krita.
Obviously we ran out of time and our scope was far too great for our skillset at the time, but I'm proud of what we got accomplished all things considered.
